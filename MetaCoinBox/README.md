### About
These are application templates that create token that can be transferred btn accounts.

Note that this is not ERC20 compatible

### Getting started

```bash
truffle unbox metacoin [PATH/TO/DIRECTORY]
```

### Running overall tests
```sh
truffle test
```

### Testing individual files
```sh
truffle test ./test/TestMetaCoin.sol && truffle test ./test/metacoin.js
```
### Compile
```sh
truffle compile
```

### Migrating with `truffle develop`
```sh
truffle develop

```

#### Note that : : By difault, `truffle migrate` will also run `truffle migrate`. So you can simply run : : 

```sh
migrate
```
#### This shows the transaction IDs and addresses of your deployed contracts. It also includes a cost summary and real-time status updates.

#### Migrate with Truffle Console to set the connection with ganache cli


```sh
# truffle-config.js

module.exports = {
    networks: {
        development: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 7545,
            network_id: ""
        }
    }
};
```

Then migrate to the contract to the blockchain created by Ganache

```sh
truffle migrate
```

To interact with the contract, you can use the Truffle console. The Truffle console is similar to Truffle Develop, except it connects to an existing blockchain (in this case, the one generated by Ganache).

```sh
truffle console
```
After , you should see this prompt
```sh
truffle(development)>
```

### Interacting with the contract

 We use `web3.eth.getAcccounts()` that returns a promise which resolves to an array of all accounts generated by the mnemonic.

 ```sh
 await web3.eth.getAccounts()[0]
 ```
That gives address 
`0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57.`

Begin by,

```sh
truffle(development)> let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed();
truffle(development)> let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
```

check the metacoin balance that deployed contract

```sh
truffle(development)> let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
truffle(development)> balance.toNumber()
```

check how much ether that balance is worth
```sh
truffle(development)> let ether = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
truffle(development)> ether.toNumber()
```

Transfer some metacoin from onr account to another
```sh
truffle(development)> instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 500)
```

CHeck the balance of the account that received ether
```sh
truffle(development)> let received = await instance.getBalance(accounts[1])
truffle(development)> received.toNumber()
```

Check the balance of the account that sent ether
```sh
truffle(development)> let newBalance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
truffle(development)> newBalance.toNumber()
```

Deploy to mainnet, testnet and beyond
```sh
truffle dashboard
```
and the run console using
```sh
--network dashboard
```
